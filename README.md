# UMqueries Backend

## Overview
The (soon to be renamed) UMqueries Backend, an integral part of the UMqueries web tool, handles data processing, API endpoints, and server-side logic for exploring and mapping RDFs (Resource Description Framework) and formulating SPARQL queries. This backend is developed with a focus on ease of integration and scalability.

## How to Use
The backend just serves the frontend application, launching the project it's all that's needed. For a comprehensive guide on how to integrate with the UMqueries frontend, please refer to our [Backend Documentation](#) (Link to be added).
