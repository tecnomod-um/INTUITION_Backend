# INTUITION: Interactive Navigation Tool for Using and Inquiring Ontology-Notated RDFs

## Overview

The INTUITION Backend, an integral part of the UMqueries web tool, handles data processing, API endpoints, and server-side logic for exploring and mapping RDFs (Resource Description Framework) that incorporate a proper ontological structure, and formulating queries. This backend is developed with a focus on ease of integration and scalability, currently being limited to SPARQL knowledge graphs.

## How to Use

The backend just serves the frontend application, launching the project it's all that's needed. For a comprehensive guide on how to integrate with the INTUITION frontend, please refer to our [Backend Documentation](DOCUMENTATION.md)
